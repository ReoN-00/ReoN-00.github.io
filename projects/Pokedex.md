The "Pokedex" project is a simple C program I developed during my sophomore year as part of an ICS class assignment. The program allows users to input various details about Pok√©mon, such as their names, nicknames, and weights, which can later be printed to the console. It was a straightforward introduction to handling user input and managing data in C, providing a foundational understanding of basic concepts.

While this project may not be overly complex, it served as an important learning experience in my coding journey. By working on this project, I gained practical skills in programming logic, data handling, and user interaction, which are essential for more advanced projects in the future. It was a small but significant step in building my confidence and proficiency in C programming.

Looking ahead, I am eager to expand on the knowledge and skills gained from this project. My goal is to create more sophisticated programs that integrate similar principles but on a larger scale. This project has inspired me to explore further possibilities in software development, and I hope to continue building on this foundation as I progress in my studies and career.
