MMD, or MikuMikuDance, is a 3D animation software originally created for animating Vocaloid characters. It has now became a tool for creating various types of animated videos. The software allows users to animate characters, choreograph dances, and create intricate scenes with relative ease, making it a popular choice for hobbyists and aspiring animators.

I started making MMD (MikuMikuDance) videos as a hobby, initially drawn by the creative freedom it offers and the ability to bring my ideas to life in a visual format. What began as a fun and engaging way to spend my free time quickly became a passion, allowing me to explore various aspects of animation and digital art. The process of creating these videos has been both challenging and rewarding, offering me a unique outlet for my creativity.

As I’ve delved deeper into MMD, I’ve realized that the skills and knowledge I’m acquiring could be applied to more significant projects. The experience has not only enhanced my understanding of animation but also opened up possibilities in areas like coding shaders in HLSL (High-Level Shading Language) and creating more complex animations. This has expanded my horizons, making me excited about the potential for growth in this field.

Looking forward, I am eager to see where this journey with MMD takes me. Whether it’s refining my current skills or exploring new technologies, I’m committed to pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve with animation.
