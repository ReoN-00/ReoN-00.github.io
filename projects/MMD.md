MMD, or MikuMikuDance, is a 3D animation software originally created for animating Vocaloid characters. It has now became a tool for creating various types of animated videos. The software allows users to animate characters, choreograph dances, and create intricate scenes with relative ease, making it a popular choice for hobbyists and aspiring animators.

I started making MMD videos as a hobby, drawn by the creative freedom and the ability to bring my ideas to life in a visual format. While it began as a fun and engaging way to spend my free time, I've come to realize that the skills and knowledge I've gained through MMD could potentially be applied to more significant projects. Whether it's creating more complex animations, or coding shaders in a language HLSL, I'm excited about what I can do with it.
