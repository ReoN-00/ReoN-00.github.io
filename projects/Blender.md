Since 2021, I have been immersing myself in the world of 3D modeling using Blender. My journey began with simple shapes and basic modeling techniques, gradually advancing to more complex projects. Through consistent practice, I've developed a strong foundation in creating detailed models, applying textures, and mastering the art of rendering.

My learning process has been primarily self-guided, utilizing a wide array of online tutorials, forums, and community resources. This approach has allowed me to learn at my own pace, experimenting with different tools and techniques within Blender. Iâ€™ve tackled challenges such as UV mapping, sculpting, and rigging, gaining confidence in my ability to bring my ideas to life.

Over the years, my experience with Blender has expanded beyond just technical skills. It has also deepened my understanding of design principles and 3D aesthetics. Each project has been an opportunity to refine my workflow, explore creative solutions, and push the boundaries of what I can achieve with this powerful tool.
