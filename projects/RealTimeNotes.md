RealTimeNotes is a web application designed to enable **real-time, collaborative note-taking**.  
Built using **Firebase Realtime Database**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and modern frontend development practices, the app allows multiple users to view and edit notes simultaneously with instantaneous updates across all connected clients.

I created RealTimeNotes as a way to explore real-time web technologies and to deepen my understanding of how collaborative applications handle synchronization, event handling, and concurrency. What started as a simple practice project quickly grew into a more technical challenge, giving me hands-on experience with:

- Real-time data synchronization using Firebase  
- Handling multi-user updates and conflict avoidance  
- Implementing a responsive and intuitive UI  
- Writing clean, modular JavaScript for scalable web apps  

Throughout development, I worked to optimize the data flow, improve performance, and ensure smooth user experiences even when multiple users edit the same document.

This project sparked an interest in **real-time systems**, **web infrastructure**, and **frontend engineering**, motivating me to explore more advanced techniques such as WebSockets, state management, and collaborative algorithms like Operational Transforms (OT) and CRDTs.

I plan to continue developing RealTimeNotes by adding features like user authentication, version history, and shared workspaces.
