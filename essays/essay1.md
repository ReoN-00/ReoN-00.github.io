Choosing a career is a big decision that affects our lives in many ways. My journey started in Fukuoka, Japan, but took a big turn when I moved to Hawaii during my freshman year of high school. Moving to a new country was hard, and it made me think a lot about what I wanted to do in the future.

When I moved, I had to get used to a new culture, language, and school system. During this time, I found a passion for coding. Coding let me create things which was exciting. As I learned more, I began thinking about working in technology in Japan, where innovation is strong.

However, I also have some doubts. Japanese companies have high standards and can be very demanding. I sometimes wonder if I have the skills needed to meet those expectations. This worry is increased because my current experience with JavaScript is not so good. Learning TypeScript, which is built on JavaScript, feels like starting from scratch for me.

Workouts of the Day (WODs), which simulates real-world coding problems under time pressure. This can be stressful for me because I prefer having more time to think before I start typing. Despite this, WODs are a good way to practice coding skills and solve problems quickly.

Learning TypeScript and doing WODs have been tough but helpful. TypeScript has improved my coding skills and taught me about modern JavaScript features, while WODs have helped me get better at solving problems quickly. Even though I’m unsure about working in Japan, these experiences have shown me that with hard work and learning, I can face these challenges and succeed in my career.

My move from Fukuoka to Hawaii has given me a special perspective that I can use wherever I work, whether in Japan or elsewhere. The path may be difficult, but with the skills I’m building in TypeScript and the experience from WODs, I’m confident that I can find a successful and fulfilling career.
