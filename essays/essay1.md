Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions in life. It can shape how we live and grow as people. My journey started in Fukuoka, Japan, where I was born. Everything changed when I moved to Hawaii during my freshman year of high school. Moving to a new country was hard, and it made me think a lot about what I wanted for my future.

Adjusting to a different culture, language, and school system was not easy. But during this time, I discovered coding. Coding quickly became something I loved because it allowed me to create and build things. This new interest made me start thinking about a career in technology.

As I continued to learn more about coding, I began to think about where I wanted to use these skills. Japan, with its advanced technology, felt like the right place for me. The idea of going back to Japan and working in a field that helps push technology forward is exciting. I can imagine myself being part of projects that make a difference in my home country.

However, I also have some worries. Moving back to Japan for work comes with challenges. Japanese companies have high standards, and sometimes I wonder if I have the skills they are looking for. The work culture in Japan is also known for being very demanding, with long hours and a lot of pressure. These things make me doubt whether I can handle working there.

Even though I have doubts, I know that choosing a career is not just about having the right skills. It’s also about having passion, being strong, and being able to adapt to new situations. My journey from Fukuoka to Hawaii has given me a different way of seeing things, and I believe this will help me in any workplace, whether in Japan or somewhere else.

My goal is to keep learning and growing as I go through this journey. The road might be difficult, but I am determined to keep moving forward. I believe that with hard work and the right attitude, I can find a successful and fulfilling career in the tech industry, no matter where it takes me. This journey is about more than just finding a job; it’s about discovering what I am capable of and what I want to achieve in life.
