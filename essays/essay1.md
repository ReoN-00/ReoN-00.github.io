Choosing a career is one of the most significant decisions in someone's life. I was born in Fukuoka, Japan, and moved to Hawaii during my freshman year of high school. This brought both challenges and opportunities in what I want for my future. Adapting to a new environment while thinking about my future was always tough for me.

In Highschool, I discovered coding, a field that became my interest. Coding was tool that I could build and create, which resonated deeply with me. As I continue to study, I started thinking about my future and where I wanted to apply these skills. Japan, my birthplace, naturally felt like the right place to pursue my career. The idea of contributing to Japan’s technological advancements and being part of that innovative environment motivates me to push forward.

However, as much as I like the idea of working in Japan, I can’t help but feel a sense of uncertainty. Moving back to Japan for work involves many factors I need to consider about. Japanese companies require a lot of skill when hiring new people. I am not sure if I have enough skills to work in United States or Japan. The work culture in Japan is known for being intense, with high expectations and long hours, which adds to my concerns about whether I will be able to meet those expectations.

Ultimately, choosing a career is about more than just skill. It’s about passion, resilience, and adaptability. While I may have doubts, I know that my journey from Fukuoka to Hawaii has equipped me with a unique perspective  that I can bring to any workplace. My goal is to continue learning and growing whether in Japan or anywhere else. This journey may be tough, but I believe that with determination, I can find a successful path in the tech industry.
