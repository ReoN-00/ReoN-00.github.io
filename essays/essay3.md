Coding standards often seem like small, inconsequential details—whether to use two or four spaces for indentation or where to place a curly brace might feel unimportant. However, I’ve come to realize that coding standards go beyond aesthetics; they significantly impact how organized and maintainable code can be. For me, coding standards help ensure that my code remains clean and consistent, making it easier to follow and manage over time.

Personally, coding standards have been helpful in keeping my code structured. Using tools like ESLint in VSCode has encouraged me to follow best practices and maintain a consistent style, which has improved the readability and organization of my work. I like the way these tools make sure my code adheres to a set of rules, which helps avoid messy or disorganized coding patterns. At the same time, I find it frustrating when ESLint flags what I consider minor issues, such as extra spaces that I intentionally leave for readability.

The strictness of ESLint can sometimes feel like a barrier. While I understand the importance of consistency, certain rules feel overly rigid. For example, if I want to space out my code for better visual separation, ESLint often treats this as an error, which disrupts my workflow. It’s moments like these when coding standards feel too strict and make me question whether every rule is necessary, especially if it doesn’t impact the code’s functionality.

That said, the process of adhering to coding standards has also made me more aware of the details in my code. By following these standards, I’ve become more careful about things like formatting, naming conventions, and other small details that might otherwise slip by unnoticed. This attention to detail not only improves the overall quality of my code but also makes me feel more confident in my programming skills.

In my experience, coding standards can also act as a learning tool. They help reinforce the structure of a language, encouraging me to write code in a way that’s both clear and efficient. Although the rules sometimes feel restrictive, they push me to think critically about my coding habits and improve areas where I might otherwise cut corners. In this way, coding standards have contributed to my growth as a developer, even if they can be a bit frustrating at times.

In conclusion, coding standards have certainly helped me become a more organized and thoughtful programmer. While I appreciate their value in keeping my code clean and consistent, I also think there’s room for a bit more flexibility, especially when it comes to personal preferences like spacing. Despite these challenges, the benefits of adhering to coding standards outweigh the frustrations, and they ultimately contribute to the quality and readability of my code.
