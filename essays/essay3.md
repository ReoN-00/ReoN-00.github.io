## The Importance of Coding Standards

Coding standards often seem like small details—whether to use two or four spaces for indentation, or where to place a curly brace might feel unimportant. However, I’ve come to realize that they significantly impact how organized and maintainable code can be. Coding standards help ensure that code remains clean and consistent, making it easier to follow and manage over time.

## How Coding Standards Have Helped Me

Personally, coding standards have been helpful in keeping my code structured. Using tools like ESLint in VSCode has encouraged me to follow best practices and maintain a consistent style, which has improved the readability and organization of my work. I like the way these tools make sure my code adheres to a set of rules, which helps avoid messy or disorganized coding patterns.

## The Challenges of Strict Standards

At the same time, I find it frustrating when ESLint flags what I consider minor issues, such as extra spaces that I intentionally leave for readability. The strictness of ESLint can sometimes feel like a barrier. While I understand the importance of consistency, certain rules feel overly rigid. For example, if I want to space out my code for better visual separation, ESLint often treats this as an error.

It’s moments like these when coding standards feel too strict, and I question whether every rule is necessary, especially if it doesn’t impact the code’s functionality.

## Becoming a More Thoughtful Programmer

That said, the process of adhering to coding standards has also made me more aware of the details in my code. By following these standards, I’ve become more careful about things like formatting, naming conventions, and other small details that might otherwise slip by unnoticed. This attention to detail not only improves the overall quality of my code but also makes me feel more confident in my programming skills.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, coding standards have certainly helped me become a more organized and thoughtful programmer. While I appreciate their value in keeping my code clean and consistent, I also think there’s room for a bit more flexibility, especially when it comes to personal preferences like spacing. D
