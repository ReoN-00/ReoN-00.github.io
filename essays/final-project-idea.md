## Overview

### The Problem
Many UH Manoa students and faculty need a reliable, easy-to-use platform to buy, sell, and trade items within the community. Currently, finding affordable secondhand items on campus—such as furniture, textbooks, and electronics—can be challenging. Students often turn to social media or other platforms, but these aren’t always secure or easy to navigate.

### The Solution
The UH Manoa Community Marketplace app addresses this need by providing a secure and centralized space for buying, selling, and trading goods within the UH community. With verification for UH students and faculty, the platform ensures only trusted users can participate, reducing safety concerns and streamlining campus-focused exchanges.

## Approach

The app will be built using **Next.js** and **React** for a responsive, user-friendly interface, along with **Bootstrap 5** for styling. The marketplace will have key features like user profiles, item listings with photos and descriptions and a wishlist function. GitHub will host the app, making it easy to manage and track development.

Each user will register and log in using their UH email address. Users can create and manage listings, communicate securely with potential buyers/sellers, and view items of interest. The platform will have unique features tailored for the UH Manoa community, enhancing campus connections and fostering sustainable reuse of resources.

## Use Case Ideas

- **Posting an Item for Sale:** A student posts a listing for a used textbook, adding a description, price, and photos. The listing appears in the main marketplace feed and can be viewed by all registered users.
  
- **Browsing and Filtering Listings:** A user browses available items, filtering by category (e.g., "Furniture," "Textbooks," "Electronics") or price range. They find a desk within their budget and contact the seller to arrange a meeting.

- **Wishlist and Notifications:** Users can add items to their wishlist and receive notifications if a similar item is listed in the future. For example, a student searching for a used calculator can add it to their wishlist and get alerts when one is listed.

## Beyond the Basic

Here are some ideas for move features to add value and enhance the user experience:

- **Verified UH Accounts:** Only users with a valid UH email can access the platform, enhancing safety and fostering trust within the community.
  
- **In-App Payment Integration:** For convenience, a secure in-app payment option could be integrated, allowing users to transact without needing cash on hand.

- **Feedback System:** After each transaction, users can rate their experience, helping others gauge the reliability of buyers and sellers. This system encourages positive interactions and accountability.
